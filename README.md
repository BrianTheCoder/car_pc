# So what is this?

I like cars. I like electronics. My stereo got jacked from my car and it is old (1994), which means its missing a lot of stuff that cars have now. Since I get bored easily, I need lots of projects to keep me occupied. I saw the raspberry pi and I like node, so I figured, what the hell, I'll build it all. So far here's what I'm planning on adding:
* media player (probably just audio, maybe streaming through my phone)
* gps and nav
* climate control
* proximity sensors
* front and rear cameras
* door lock control
* window control
* automatic lights

Needless to say this will be a lot of work and fairly expensive. I plan on having the pi read from all the following sensors, maybe from an arduino with a firmata on it communicating via johnny-five. Still working out the kinks. I plan on adding the following sensors to communicate with the pi
* proximity sensors (debating ir or sonar) on all 4 corners
* compass
* gps
* 3 axis accelerometer
* temperature
* light sensor

Keep watching. I plan on trying to produce what I learn from this in kit form, so keep an eye out.
